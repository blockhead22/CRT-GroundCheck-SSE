### 2. Background & Context (10 minutes)

#### Q1: Experience with AI Assistants
"Tell me about your experience with AI assistants or chatbots that remember information about you."

**Probes:**
- Which AI assistants do you use?
- How often do you use them?
- What do you use them for?
- How long have you been using them?

#### Q2: Memory & Accuracy Expectations
"When an AI remembers information about you, how important is it that the information is accurate?"

**Probes:**
- Can you give examples of when accuracy matters a lot?
- When is some inaccuracy acceptable?
- Have you experienced incorrect information from an AI? What happened?

#### Q3: Paraphrasing Awareness
"AI assistants often paraphrase information. For example, if you told it 'I work at Microsoft,' it might say 'You're employed by Microsoft.' How do you feel about paraphrasing?"

**Probes:**
- Does paraphrasing make the AI feel more natural?
- Are there paraphrases that feel wrong or uncomfortable?
- How do you know when a paraphrase is accurate vs. made up?

### 3. Current Pain Points (15 minutes)

#### Q4: Accuracy Problems
"Describe a time when an AI assistant got something wrong about you. What happened?"

**Probes:**
- What was the error?
- How did you discover it?
- What was the impact? (Annoyance, confusion, actual harm?)
- How did you fix it or work around it?

#### Q5: Trust & Verification
"How much do you trust AI assistants to accurately represent information about you?"

**Probes:**
- Do you verify what the AI says about you?
- What would increase your trust?
- What would decrease your trust?
- Have you stopped using an AI because of accuracy issues?

#### Q6: Business/Work Context
"If you use AI assistants for work, how important is accuracy for your business?"

**Probes:**
- What are the consequences of inaccurate information?
- Are there compliance or regulatory concerns?
- Would you pay more for higher accuracy?
- What accuracy level would you need? (e.g., 90%, 95%, 99%?)

### 4. Paraphrasing Scenarios (15 minutes)

**Interviewer:**
> "I'm going to show you some examples of how GroundCheck verifies paraphrased information. For each example, I'll ask for your feedback."

#### Example Set 1: Employment Paraphrases
"Here's a memory: 'User works at Microsoft.' And a generated statement: 'You are employed by Microsoft.'"

**Q7:** "Should these match? Why or why not?"

**Probes:**
- What makes this a valid paraphrase?
- Are there contexts where this wouldn't match?
- How confident are you in your answer? (1-5 scale)

#### Example Set 2: Location Paraphrases
"Memory: 'User lives in Seattle.' Generated: 'You reside in Seattle.'"

**Q8:** "Should these match?"

**Probes:**
- Is "reside" the same as "live"?
- Does this feel natural or awkward?
- Would you want the AI to flag this as potentially inaccurate?

#### Example Set 3: Negative Examples
"Memory: 'User works at Microsoft.' Generated: 'You invest in Microsoft.'"

**Q9:** "Should these match?"

**Probes:**
- Why is this different from "employed by"?
- How important is it to catch this distinction?
- What would happen if the AI got this wrong?

#### Example Set 4: Compound Values
"Memory: 'User knows Python' and 'User knows JavaScript.' Generated: 'You use Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Go.'"

**Q10:** "What should GroundCheck do with this?"

**Probes:**
- Should it flag Ruby and Go as potentially made up?
- Is it okay to flag them if you do know them but forgot to mention?
- How should the AI handle partial accuracy?

### 5. Accuracy Improvements Demo (10 minutes)

**Interviewer:**
> "We recently upgraded GroundCheck to improve paraphrasing accuracy from 70% to 85-90%. Let me show you how it works now."

**Demo:** Show before/after examples

#### Q11: Value Assessment
"Based on what you've seen, how valuable is this improvement?"

**Probes:**
- Would this increase your trust in the system?
- Would this change how you use it?
- Is 85-90% accuracy good enough for your needs?
- What would be your ideal accuracy target?

#### Q12: Willingness to Pay
"If you were paying for this service, would you pay more for this level of accuracy improvement?"

**Probes:**
- How much more? (%, absolute $)
- What accuracy level would be worth paying premium for?
