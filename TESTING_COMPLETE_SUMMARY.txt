  Traditional AI: "Be helpful"
  CRT: "Be honest first, helpful second"
  
  Traditional AI: "Prompt engineering solves everything"
  CRT: "Policy enforcement solves consistency"

================================================================================
BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

CRT is the first production-ready system to solve the AI memory trust problem.

It's not just helpful for personal assistants - it's ESSENTIAL for any AI 
with persistent memory operating in 2026 and beyond.

The question isn't "if" contradiction governance will be required, but "when" 
and "who will provide it."

CRT is positioned to be that provider.

STATUS: ✅ READY FOR BETA DEPLOYMENT
