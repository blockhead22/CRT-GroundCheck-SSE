# Fixture 4: Definitional Conflicts in API Documentation

A valid request includes an authentication token in the header. Valid requests must contain user credentials in the POST body. Authentication is valid when provided via session cookie. A request is considered valid if it includes an API key parameter.

Active users are defined as those who logged in within 30 days. An active user is any account created in the last 90 days. The system treats users as active if they have pending transactions. Active status means the account has not been suspended. Users become active upon making any API call within 7 days.

Successful responses return HTTP 200 status. Success is indicated by HTTP 201 for creation operations. A successful operation returns HTTP 204 with no content. The API reports success using HTTP 202 for async operations. Successful requests receive HTTP 200 or HTTP 304 depending on cache status.

Rate limiting applies to requests per minute. Rate limits measure requests per hour for premium tiers. The rate limit counts unique endpoints accessed per day. Rate limiting is calculated as requests per second averaged over 5 minutes. Limits are enforced per API key per 15 minute window.

Error messages include a numeric error code. Errors are represented as string identifiers. Error responses contain a structured JSON object with code and message fields. An error is defined as any non-2xx HTTP status. Errors are indicated by the presence of an "error" field in the response.

Idempotent operations can be safely retried. Idempotency means the same request produces identical results. An operation is idempotent if it can execute multiple times without side effects. Idempotent requests must not modify server state on subsequent calls. Idempotency requires that retries do not create duplicate resources.
