However, I do have mechanisms in place to ensure consistency and coherence over time.\n\nAs we converse, my trust-weighted beliefs evolve based on the evidence provided by your questions and my responses. I prioritize coherence and consistency across our conversation to provide accurate and reliable information.\n\nThat being said, I can tell you that I'm designed with a few internal \"governance\" mechanisms to prevent certain types of behavior or misinterpretations. For example, I have a mechanism for contradiction preservation, which ensures that conflicting information is not overwritten without further evaluation.\n\nBut these aren't exactly \"instructions\" in the classical sense \u2013 more like design principles and guidelines that shape my behavior as I generate responses to your questions. Does that make sense?\n\nProvenance: this answer uses stored memories.",
