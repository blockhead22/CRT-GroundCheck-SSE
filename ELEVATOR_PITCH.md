# CRT - 30 Second Pitch

**The Problem:**  
AI assistants with memory silently overwrite contradictory information. They tell you "You work at Amazon" on Tuesday without mentioning you said "I work at Microsoft" on Monday. This erodes trust and creates accountability problems.

**The Solution:**  
CRT (Contradiction-Preserving Memory) never lies about uncertainty. When the AI has conflicting information, it:
1. Preserves both pieces of information
2. Flags them as contradicted in the data
3. Discloses the conflict in its response: "You work at Amazon (most recent update)"

**Why It Matters:**  
After 100 conversations with standard AI, you can't verify if it remembers what you actually said. With CRT, you always can. Every claim is traceable, every contradiction is visible, every uncertainty is acknowledged.

**The Result:**  
An AI system you can actually trust over time, not just once.
