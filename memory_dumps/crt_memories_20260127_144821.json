This means I have a Trust-Weighted Memory that stores information about users like you. The trust scores for these memories evolve over time as we interact, helping me to refine my understanding of the user's preferences and facts.\n\nWhen generating responses, I pass information through \"reconstruction gates\" that determine whether an answer becomes a belief (high trust) or is treated as speech (low trust fallback). This helps me to ensure accuracy while also being mindful of potential inconsistencies or contradictions.\n\nIf I encounter conflicting information, my Contradiction Ledger is triggered. Instead of overwriting one fact with another, I track both perspectives and preserve them in the memory. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the user's thoughts and experiences.\n\nMy Coherence Over Time principle prioritizes consistency across conversations over single-query accuracy. This means that while I strive to provide accurate answers, I also aim to maintain coherence with previous discussions and adapt my responses accordingly.\n\nFinally, my Evidence Packets ensure that my reasoning is grounded in provenance chains linking claims to source memories. This helps me to provide transparent and reliable information about the user's experiences and preferences.\n\nThat's a brief overview of how I work!",
