Grounding verification systems detect when large language model (LLM) outputs contain claims unsupported by retrieved context. However, existing methods assume retrieved context is internally consistent. In long-term memory systems, context often contains contradictory information as beliefs and facts update over time.

We present \textbf{GroundCheck}, the first contradiction-aware grounding verification system. GroundCheck detects when retrieved memories contradict each other and verifies that generated outputs appropriately acknowledge these contradictions.

We introduce \textbf{GroundingBench}, a benchmark with 500 examples across five categories, including 100 examples specifically designed to test contradiction handling. On GroundingBench, GroundCheck achieves 90\% accuracy on contradiction detection compared to $\sim$30\% for existing methods, while maintaining competitive performance on standard grounding tasks (76\% vs 82\%).

Our results demonstrate that grounding verification for long-term AI systems requires explicit contradiction handling—a capability absent from current approaches.
