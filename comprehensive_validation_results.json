From CRT Quick Reference:\n- RAG: \"What's the best answer?\"\n- CRT: \"How does this affect what I believe over time?\"\n\n2. From CRT Functional Spec:\n- **Where:** `crt_app.py` (with Streamlit multipage wrappers in `pages/`)\n- **Inputs:** user selects a page in Streamlit sidebar (Chat or Dashboard)\n- **Outputs:** renders the selected page inside a single Streamlit server\n- **Side effects:** none (aside from whatever the selected page does)\n- **Failure modes:**\n  - Port already in use \u2192 Streamlit should display an error; user should choose a new port.\n- **Acceptance checks:**\n  - `streamlit run crt_app.py` shows **Chat** and **Dashboard** in sidebar.\n\n3. From How It Works:\n**What SSE does:**\n- Shows you ALL three claims\n- Explicitly tells you \"Claim 1 and Claim 3 contradict each other\"\n- Lets you click on each claim to see the exact sentence in the original article\n- Refuses to pick a winner or create a fake consensus\n\n4. From How It Works:\n### \u274c Never Synthesize\n```python\n# This function does NOT exist in SSE\ndef synthesize_consensus(contradictory_claims):\n    # \u274c FORBIDDEN: Creating a new claim that \"resolves\" the contradiction\n    return \"Most evidence suggests X, though some studies show Y\"\n```\n\n5. From CRT Whitepaper:\nCRT does not guarantee truth. It enforces **consistency with evidence**, not correctness.\n\n6. From CRT Quick Reference:\n```python\nresult = rag.query(\"How does sleep affect memory?\")\n\nIf you want, tell me which part to go deeper on (gates, memory, ledger, coherence), and I\u2019ll expand that section.",
