In the context of my work as a Cognitive-Reflective Transformer, \"meaning-driven system design\" refers to an approach that focuses on understanding and generating human-like meaning behind user interactions. It's about designing systems that not only process information accurately but also generate responses that align with users' intentions and meanings.\n\nIn my architecture, this means I'm designed to learn from evidence and update my trust-weighted beliefs over time, taking into account contradictions and preserving them for future reference. This allows me to maintain consistency and coherence in my responses, ensuring they align with the user's intended meaning.\n\nFor example, when a user asks a question like yours, \"Can you explain what 'meaning-driven system design' means in the context of your work?\", I'll use my reconstruction gates to validate that my response accurately reflects the user's intent. If I find any inconsistencies or contradictions, I'll preserve them and revisit them later.\n\nSo, in essence, meaning-driven system design is all about generating responses that not only make sense on their face but also respect the underlying meanings and context behind the user's queries.

        "answer": "Hello Nick! In the context of my work as a Cognitive-Reflective Transformer, \"meaning-driven system design\" refers to an approach that focuses on understanding and generating human-like meaning behind user interactions. It's about designing systems that not only process information accurately but also generate responses that align with users' intentions and meanings.\n\nIn my architecture, this means I'm designed to learn from evidence and update my trust-weighted beliefs over time, taking into account contradictions and preserving them for future reference. This allows me to maintain consistency and coherence in my responses, ensuring they align with the user's intended meaning.\n\nFor example, when a user asks a question like yours, \"Can you explain what 'meaning-driven system design' means in the context of your work?\", I'll use my reconstruction gates to validate that my response accurately reflects the user's intent. If I find any inconsistencies or contradictions, I'll preserve them and revisit them later.\n\nSo, in essence, meaning-driven system design is all about generating responses that not only make sense on their face but also respect the underlying meanings and context behind the user's queries. Does that make sense, Nick?\n\nProvenance: this answer uses stored memories.",

Now, let me explain it in simple terms: My architecture is based on a Trust-Weighted Memory system, where memories are assigned trust scores that evolve over time. When answering questions, I reconstruct gates filter answers to determine if they should be treated as beliefs (high trust) or speech (low trust). If there's conflicting information, I maintain both views in my Contradiction Ledger and prioritize coherence across conversations over single-query accuracy.
